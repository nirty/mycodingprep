Dijkstra single source shortest path algorithm
PreReq:
=======
- The data structure must be a graph i.e all verticies must be connected
- All verticies must have a inital value (say a high number == infinity)
- All edges must have a weight

Concept:
=======
- Choose the min distance vertex and mark it as settled
- Relax its neighbours
- Update the neighbour with its predecessor
- Continue from step 1 untill all vertices are marked as settled
- Now the predecessor path from any vertex gives the shortest path to the source (ie head Vertex)

Pseudo code:
===========
- Choose a vertex as a starting point(head) and assign its value to 0
- Since the starting point doesnt have a predecessor, assign its predecessor to null
- Insert it to a BinaryHeap (priority queue, pQ)
1. Remove the min vertex from the pQ
2. Check if min vertex is present in map data structure [(ie settled queue, sQ) with key = vertex->Name : value = vertext]
  -- if min vertex is present in sQ , proceed from step 1
  -- if min vertex is not present in the sQ, mark it as settled and add to the sQ
3. Start relaxing the min vertex[Vcurrent] neighbours and updating the neighbour predecessor with the min vertex
  -- Using the edges, get the vertex[Vneighbour] that is not settled yet
  -- if the distance from (Vcurrent + Ecurrent-neighbour) is less than the Vneighbour value, then
     --- update the Vneighbour value with (Vcurrent + Ecurrent-neighbour)
	 --- updated the Vneighbour predecessor with Vcurrent
	 --- insert the Vneighbour to the pQ
4. Continue from Step 1, untill the pQ is empty
5. The sQ contains the vertices with shortest path to the source
